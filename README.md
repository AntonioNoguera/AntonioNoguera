  Interests:
Definitely the branch that interests me the most is Back - End development, since one of my best areas is data management, and applying optimization techniques to these is something that particularly catches my attention.
  
For this reason, I am very interested in projects in which large amounts of information are generated and used at the same tiem.

I am currently exploring the branch of AI, and how it could be implemented to data manipulation projects.
